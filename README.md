A sloppy work-in-progress.

- Interactive Demo: [https://www.danneu.com/elm-hex-grid/](https://www.danneu.com/elm-hex-grid/)

The live demo is pretty cool, but it's also pretty slow because I reused the same
model for all of the examples. That means when you update one example, all 
of the examples re-render.

I should have used a fresh model for each example.
